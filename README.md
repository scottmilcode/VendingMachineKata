To Build
--------
Code example has an accompanying gradle build file.  Executing 'gradle build' from the project directory will build
the code and run all tests, compiling a .jar file.  

Additionally the gradle wrapper has been provided as well such that the project can be built if you do not have gradle
already installed.  Only an internet connection is required.
